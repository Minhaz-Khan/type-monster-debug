                    <p class="card-text">sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data
                        in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
                        Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets
                        created and assigned to that particular tab</p>

                    <h6>Gobal scope</h6>
                    The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                    have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                    program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br>
                    <h6>Block Scope</h6>
                    Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                    variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                    statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the
                    curly brackets {}.

                    <p class="card-text">The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking
                        operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the
                        task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed
